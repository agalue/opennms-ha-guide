== Architecture

.Basic architecture for the OpenNMS cluster setup
image::basic-architecture.png[]

The above diagram describes the basic architecture.
It is important to notice that _CMAN/Ricci/Rgmanager_ will be used for _RHEL/CentOS 6_, and _Pacemaker_ will be used for _RHEL/CentOS 7_.

The _RedHat Cluster_ consist on two machines (or virtual machines) for the _Primary OpenNMS_, and the _Standby OpenNMS_.

Each _OpenNMS_ machine will have _pgpool-II_ installed.
This will be the gateway to the _PostgreSQL Cluster_.
In other words, in terms of _OpenNMS_, the database is installed locally, even knowing that _PostgreSQL_ is not running on the _OpenNMS_ servers.

The _pgpool-II_ configuration is another common resource that can be hosted on an external machine (like the _OpenNMS_ configuration and data directories).

The cluster will provide a floating IP, which will be used by the operators to access the active _OpenNMS_ server.

In case of a failure, the floating IP, the shared file systems, the _pgpool-II_ application and the _OpenNMS_ application will be moved to the standby server.

The _PostgreSQL Database_ will have its own cluster using streaming replication between the master and the standby server, and will use _pgpool-II_ to access the _PostgreSQL Cluster_.

Because security is important, _SELinux_ must be configured to be "enforcing", and the internal firewall (iptables on _RHEL/CentOS 6_, or _firewalld_ on _RHEL/CentOS 7_) must be enabled on all the servers involved on this cluster solution.

=== Fencing/Stonith

Fencing is a vital part of clustering which helps maintain data integrity by ensuring that out-of-sync, misbehaving nodes are removed from the cluster before they can do damage.

This is one of the first things you’ll want to configure, if you want to avoid trouble. Nodes without a configured fence device sometimes can hang the entire cluster, as the other nodes wait for it to be fenced (which will be a very very long time if you haven’t configured fencing at all).

This can be accomplished in a variety of ways; for example, powering off the node via a remote power switch, disabling a _Fiber Channel_ switch port, or powering off the virtual machine on which the cluster node is hosted through the _VM Manager_ (like _vCenter_).

_STONITH_ footnote:["Shoot The Other Node In The Head" or "Shoot The Offending Node In The Head"], sometimes called _STOMITH_ footnote:["Shoot The Other Member/Machine In The Head"], is a technique for fencing in computer clusters.
You can see either the term "Fence" (or "Fencing"), or the term _STONITH_ interchangeable on this document.
Typically _CMAN_ environments uses the term _Fencing_, while _Pacemaker_ environment uses the term _Stonith_.

It is recommended to investigate which fencing mechanism works better for the final deployment and configure it properly to avoid "split-brain" situations and potential corruption of the data.
