Fencing script for _VirtualBox_ designed for _RHEL/CentOS 7_

NOTE: If youâ€™re running _VirtualBox_ on _Linux_, you must update the `vboxmanage` variable to point to the correct location of `VBoxManage`.
      Also, be careful with the indentation, this is a mandatory format for any _python_ script.
      Each level has 4 spaces for indentation.
