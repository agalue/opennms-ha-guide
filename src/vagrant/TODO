When upgrading OpenNMS, be sure to have a local copy of the shared configuration.
Otherwise, you'll see error when updating the RPM packages.

PG Extensions for PGpool-II:
sudo -u postgres psql template1
=# CREATE EXTENSION pgpool_recovery;
=# CREATE EXTENSION pgpool_adm;
=# \q

If LoadBalancing won't be used consider pgbouncer for connection polling.

Install pgpoolAdmin

We need to improve the SSH-Key generation to include Cassandra for Spark.
We should create 2 authorized_keys, one for the ONMS+Postgres Servers,
and another for the ONMS+Cassandra Servers.

Install Scala 2.11 through RPMs on the OpenNMS and Cassandra nodes.
 http://downloads.lightbend.com/scala/2.11.8/scala-2.11.8.rpm
Create a user for Spark
Install the keys for the Spark User
Dowload and uncompress the Spark binary
 http://d3kbcqa49mib13.cloudfront.net/spark-2.1.0-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz
Download the spark-cassandra-connector JAR
 http://dl.bintray.com/spark-packages/maven/datastax/spark-cassandra-connector/2.0.1-s_2.11/spark-cassandra-connector-2.0.1-s_2.11.jar
 $SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-shell --packages datastax:spark-cassandra-connector:2.0.1-s_2.11
Setup the environment variables for the Spark User
Setup the conf/slaves on the OpenNMS machines (point to /opt/opennms/etc)
Execute start-all.sh on the active OpenNMS

Note: Spark can be added to the Linux Cluster only if it is going to run
      streaming applications.
